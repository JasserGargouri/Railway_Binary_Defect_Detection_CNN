Automated defect detection in railway infrastructure is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern railway networks. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight and large-parameter transfer learning architectures for binary defect classification in rail and fastener components. Using publicly available datasets, we benchmark several pretrained CNN models: ResNet152V2, ConvNeXtSmall, ConvNeXtTiny, EfficientNetV2B0, MobileNetV3-Large, and NASNetMobile under our unified training pipeline. A custom classification head is applied consistently across all architectures, and the best-performing lightweight model is further fine-tuned. Experimental results show that our finetuned EfficientNetV2B0 model achieves the highest performance on the combined dataset of rails and fasteners, reaching an F1-score of 0.94 and surpassing the baseline model reported in the original dataset publication while using a lot fewer parameters. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm improved defect-focused attention after fine-tuning. The results demonstrate that when combined with an appropriate training and fine-tuning strategy, compact transfer learning models can achieve state-of-the-art performance while remaining suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained inspection platforms.
